# LeetCode Patterns

A collection of common patterns and techniques for solving LeetCode problems.

## 1. Two Pointers

**Description:** Use two pointers to traverse an array or string from different ends or directions.
**When to use:** Sorted arrays, finding pairs, removing duplicates, reversing.
**Common Problems:**
-   Two Sum II
-   3Sum
-   Container With Most Water

## 2. Sliding Window

**Description:** Maintain a window of elements within an array or string and slide it to process the data.
**When to use:** Longest/shortest substring, subarray sums, anagrams.
**Common Problems:**
-   Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
-   Minimum Window Substring

## 3. Fast & Slow Pointers (Tortoise and Hare)

**Description:** Use two pointers moving at different speeds.
**When to use:** Cycle detection in linked lists, finding middle of linked list.
**Common Problems:**
-   Linked List Cycle
-   Middle of the Linked List

## 4. Binary Search

**Description:** Divide and conquer on a sorted dataset.
**When to use:** Sorted arrays, finding value in range.
**Common Problems:**
-   Binary Search
-   Search in Rotated Sorted Array

## 5. Depth First Search (DFS)

**Description:** Traverse a tree or graph as deep as possible before backtracking.
**When to use:** Tree traversals, graph connections, permutations/combinations.
**Common Problems:**
-   Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
-   Number of Islands

## 6. Breadth First Search (BFS)

**Description:** Traverse a tree or graph level by level.
**When to use:** Shortest path in unweighted graph, level order traversal.
**Common Problems:**
-   Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
-   Rotting Oranges

## 7. Dynamic Programming

**Description:** Solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results.
**When to use:** Optimization problems, counting ways, min/max path.
**Common Problems:**
-   Climbing Stairs
-   House Robber
-   Longest Palindromic Substring
